Back in my second bachelor year, I was shocked by the lack of artistic creativity in my technical university. I thus decided to fictively found GDC, the **Graphic Designer Community** at ETH Zurich.

The idea eventually ended up in an almost ready-to-go platform (accessible under [gdcz.ch](https://gdcz.gitlab.io/home/){:target="_blank"}), but due to a lack of time, mainly remained at the state of under-developed dream and never reached its full potential. Below can be found some graphics in the theme of the organization.

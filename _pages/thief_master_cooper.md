When [Sucker Punch](https://www.suckerpunch.com){:target="_blank"} released their first spectacular title **Sly Cooper**, I very quickly became captivated by the soon-becoming franchise. 15 years down the line, I decided to play the charming raccoon's story again and to give it a little attention on my 3D graphics journey.

>In 2020, the studio released a new masterpiece for PlayStation, **Ghost of Tsushima**, which I highly encourage playing.

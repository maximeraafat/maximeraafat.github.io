An exciting collaboration with [TCG Inventory](https://www.tcginventory.ch){:target="_blank"}; good friends of mine and, among other things, a team of highly talented engineers pioneering the trading card game space. I had the unique chance to bring their <i>Card Butler</i> to life through a set of promotional renders.

**Machine Perception** is a lecture taught at ETH Zurich, tackling the **most recent deep learning** approaches and architectures for perception tasks, such as **Variational Auto-Encoders**, **Generative Adversial Networks** or **Normalizing Flows**. Towards the end of the semester, we had the opportunity to have some hands-on experience by implementing a state-of-the-art network for a concrete application in a small group. In my group, we focused on **estimating Optical Flow** by starting with [Nvidia's PWC-Net](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/html/Sun_PWC-Net_CNNs_for_CVPR_2018_paper.html){:target="_blank"} and building on top of it our own architecture, Seg-Net, which achieves better results.

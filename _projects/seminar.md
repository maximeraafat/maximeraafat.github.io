### Research Talks

During my time at the [VLG](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch){:target="_blank"}, I have occasionally been responsible for hosting our group's **weekly talk** with purpose of sharing knowledge in a field related to our lab's research direction.

> Below you will find the material I presented during these talks.

### Case Studies

The aim of the **Case Studies** seminar is for students in Computatial Sciences to get industry insights in natural sciences, computer sciences or other related fields from a computational perspective. The course further intends to improve the students **presentation skills** when showcasing **scientific publications**.

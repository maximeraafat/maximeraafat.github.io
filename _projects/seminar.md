Throughout my studies at ETH and my time as a research assistant at the [VLG](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch){:target="_blank"}, I have been given the opportunity to present various works and research papers in the frame of **seminars**. The aim for these talks were either to explore a related research topic in depth, or to improve one's **presentation skills** in the context of **scientific writing**.

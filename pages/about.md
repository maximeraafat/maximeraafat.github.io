# **About Me**
<hr class="short">

Already <script src='/js/calculateAge.js'></script> revolutions around the sun, still not a single coffee during my long coding nights (and days). I aspire to make the world a better place through computer vision, graphics and AI innovations, while still enjoying each moment spent along my family, friends and PlayStation.

Curious for more? Have a look at my [**Projects**](/projects) or my [**Creative Blog**](/blog), where I share some of my favorite homemade creations!

You saw enough already? I highly recommend checking out [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/inanutshell){:target="_blank"}, a fantastic YouTube channel devoted to storytelling and breaking down factual information in many scientific fields.

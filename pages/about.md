# **About Me**
<hr class="short">

Hi, I'm **Maxime**! I create worlds that do not exist.

In <script src='/js/calculateAge.js'></script> years of life XP, still not a single drop of coffee. Yet even then I prefer coding by night. Through innovations in computer graphics, computer vision, AI, and practical artistic approaches, I aspire to advance immersive and virtual experiences that make the world a better place. When not at my desk or working up a sweat, I am likely spending time with my family, friends, or PlayStation (try all three at once, not easy but doable).

Curious for more? Check out my [**Projects**](/projects) or my [**Creative Blog**](/blog), where I share my favorite homemade creations!

Had enough? Then definitely give [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/inanutshell){:target="_blank"} a look, a fantastic YouTube channel that breaks down scientific topics with engaging storytelling.

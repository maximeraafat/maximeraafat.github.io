# **About Me**
<hr class="short">

Hi, I'm **Maxime**! I create worlds that do not exist.

In my <script src='/js/calculateAge.js'></script> years of life experience, I've never touched a single drop of coffee; yet I still prefer coding by night. Through modern computer graphics, computer vision, AI and practical artistic approaches, I aspire to enable visual immersive experiences that make the world a better place. When not sitting at my desk, you'll likely find me enjoying time with my family, friends or PlayStation.

Had enough? I highly recommend checking out [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/inanutshell){:target="_blank"}, a fantastic YouTube channel that breaks down scientific topics with engaging storytelling.

# **About Me**
<hr align='left' style='height:{{site.height}}; width:{{site.width}}'>

Hi, I am **Maxime**!

Already <script src='/js/calculateAge.js'></script> revolutions around the sun, still not a single coffee during my long coding nights (and days). <br>
I aspire to make the world a better place through AI and computer vision innovations, while still enjoying each moment spent along my family, friends and PlayStation.
